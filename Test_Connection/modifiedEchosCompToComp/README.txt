Run this with

java EchoClient 127.0.0.1

java EchoServer

on 2 different cmd's on the same computer.
This runs it on port 55555 which is hard coded in the program targeting the loopback address so you can
see the interactions between the 2. In this version, the server sends a string and the client sends it back.
